# OSM_building_prediction

This repository contains code used to predict residential/non-residential status of OSM buildings, published [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204399).

For a worked example using OSM data from Swaziland, see [here](https://github.com/disarm-platform/OSM_building_prediction/blob/master/tutorial.md). Note that if you download the latest OSM data, results will likely be slightly different from those in the tutorial, which uses data as available in July 2018.
